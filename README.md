## Features

### Blocks, Addresses, Transactions

The Explorer application allows you to transition seamlessly between blocks, addresses, and transactions. Blocks act as record book for transactions. You can also access the addresses, which is a unique identifier where cryptocurrency can be sent. Or you may view the transactions themselves. Below are videos that demonstrate basic navigation of the application.


* The front page of the application consists of current blocks that have stored recently made transactions. All transactions provide the addresses of origin and delivery, time of transaction, and the amount delivered. You may find the addresses on the blocks.
